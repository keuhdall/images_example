	 Why so ? Let me explain : This char* will represent your image, pixel by pixel,
	 and the values of this array are the colors. That's why the array is 4 times bigger :
	 you need 4 char to code the color of each pixels (one for Red, Green and Blue) and one for the alpha.
	 But... it's not very convenient, right ? So here is my little trick : you cast
	 mlx_get_data_addr as an int* and store it in an int*.
	 This way, the array will have the exact same size as your window, and each index
	 will represent one complete color of a pixel !

				 Now one thing to understand here is that you're working on a 1-dimensional

				 So, instead of having data[height][width] here you'll have the following
				 formula : [current height * max width + current width] (as you can see below)
